Write an Obsidian plugin called `anglicize` that converts American English spellings to British English. The plugin should:
- Process text in a selected note or across the entire vault.
- Provide a real-time inline correction feature.
- Allow users to define exceptions (e.g., keep "program" unchanged in code notes).
- Integrate with the Obsidian Linter for consistency checking.
- Offer a toggle for Passive-Aggressive Mode™ (adds sarcastic annotations).
- Include a Cheeky Mode™ for excessive Britishisms.

The plugin should be built using TypeScript and follow Obsidian's Plugin API standards. Use a simple dictionary lookup to handle common word conversions.

See specs.md for detailed Specifications.
