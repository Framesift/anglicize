Brilliant. anglicize for Obsidian.

🔠 What It Does:
A lightweight plugin that:
	•	Converts 🇺🇸 American English → 🇬🇧 British English across an entire note or vault.
	•	Corrects AI-generated text that insists on using US spellings.
	•	Standardises terminology for consistency in research, documentation, or creative writing.
	•	Supports user-defined exceptions (e.g., leave “program” in code-related notes).
	•	Optional “Passive-Aggressive Mode™” that highlights incorrect spellings with disdainful annotations.

🤖 Implementation Considerations:
	•	Uses Obsidian’s inline text processing to offer real-time suggestions.
	•	Can apply bulk edits or work on a per-word basis.
	•	Potential integration with Obsidian Linter to flag inconsistencies.
	•	Includes a cheeky mode that corrects spelling and adds unnecessary “u”s just for fun (colourise, favouritise, honourificabilitudinitatibus).

📌 Bonus Feature Idea:
	•	“Anglophile Mode”: Rewrites Americanised phrasing into more British alternatives (e.g., sidewalk → pavement, elevator → lift, fries → chips).
	•	“Reverse Anglicize”: For those who dare to tread the path of least resistance.

✅ Live Highlighting – Underline incorrect words in real-time.
✅ User Custom Dictionary – Allow exceptions and custom replacements.
✅ Interactive Fixes – Right-click menu for manual correction.
✅ Cheeky Mode™ – Apply over-the-top Britishisms for extra flair.
✅ Passive-Aggressive Mode™ – Annotate corrections with a dry, disapproving tone.
✅ Obsidian Linter Integration – Flag words for consistency checking.

3️⃣ Workflow for AI-Generated Plugin Code

Prompt for AI Code Generation

Write an Obsidian plugin called `anglicize` that converts American English spellings to British English. The plugin should:
- Process text in a selected note or across the entire vault.
- Provide a real-time inline correction feature.
- Allow users to define exceptions (e.g., keep "program" unchanged in code notes).
- Integrate with the Obsidian Linter for consistency checking.
- Offer a toggle for Passive-Aggressive Mode™ (adds sarcastic annotations).
- Include a Cheeky Mode™ for excessive Britishisms.

The plugin should be built using TypeScript and follow Obsidian's Plugin API standards. Use a simple dictionary lookup to handle common word conversions.

4️⃣ Implementation Steps

1️⃣ Generate AI Code – Feed the prompt into an LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) to produce an initial plugin.
2️⃣ Run Tests – Validate core conversions using test cases.
3️⃣ Refine Features – Implement user preferences and interactive fixes.
4️⃣ Optimize Performance – Ensure smooth vault-wide scanning without lag.
5️⃣ Deploy & Iterate – Publish as an Obsidian community plugin (or keep it as a private tool).
